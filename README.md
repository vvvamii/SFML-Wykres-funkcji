# SFML2 Graphing calculator / kalkulator graficzny  


## About  

Old project from 2020. Written with C++ and using SFML2 for the graphic interface, this program allows you to enter a polynomial function via console. After that the program shows you the graph of the function entered.  


## Features  

- Graphic interface
- Polynomial function graphing
- Music in the background (yes, really - you can disable it though)  

## How to use  

First thing you need to do is to enter the degree of the polynomial function (eg. quadratic function = 2).  

Next you will be asked to enter the coefficients for every single power (eg. linear function -> enter coefficient for x^1 and x^0).  

Finally, the result will be shown in the main window. From there you can use various options show in the menu or enter another function.
